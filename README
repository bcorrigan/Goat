An IRC bot with many commands, written by me and robotslave, if we forget abotu the fact that huge chunks of goat's interior have been lifted from many parts of the internet over the last ten years.

Nearly all written in java, apart from the twitter stuff which is in scala.

Probably more useful to steal code from for your own bot, than to run your own instance, which would be a painful experience probably, as goat has not been designed for easy public consumption:
