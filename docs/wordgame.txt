Saying "wordgame" in chan starts a new game of wordgame. I say some scrambled letters, you guess words that fit for points. Longest wins. Longer the word, the longer the time you have.
#wordgame# - starts a new game of wordgame. First to 168 points wins.
#scores# - shows the scores in the current game
#matchscores# - shows overall scores, ever (matches won).
